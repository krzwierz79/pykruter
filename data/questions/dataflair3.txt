Q.1. What are the key features of Python?


Dynamically-typed
Concise and simple
Has a large community
Q.2. Differentiate between lists and tuples.
>>> mylist=[1,3,3]

>>> mytuple=(1,3,3)



File ‚Äú<pyshell#97>‚Äù, line 1, in <module>
TypeError: tuple object does not support item assignment
Q.3. Explain the ternary operator in Python.
[on true] if [expression] else [on false]
Below is how you would use it:

>>> min=a if a<b else b

 2
Hi
Lets take a list for this.
A negative index, unlike a positive one, begins searching from the right.
6
>>> mylist[-6:-1]
Q.5. Is Python case-sensitive?
>>> myname='Ayushi'

Traceback (most recent call last):
Myname
As you can see, this raised a NameError. This means that Python is indeed case-sensitive.
According to the official Python documentation, an identifier can be of any length. However, PEP 8 suggests that you should limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. Also, PEP 20 says ëreadability countsí. So, a very long

Apart from that, there are certain rules we must follow to name one:
It can only begin with an underscore or a character from A-Z or a-z.
Python is case-sensitive, as we discussed in the previous question.

Learn everything about Python Identifiers
We use the lower() method for this.
ayushi
>>> 'AyuShi'.upper()
Also, to check if a string is in all uppercase or all lowercase, we use the methods isupper() and islower().
False
True
True
True
True
Also, istitle() will tell us if a string is in title case.
True
There may be times in our code when we havent decided what to do yet, but we must type something for it to be syntactically correct. In such a case, we use the pass statement.

pass

 Similarly, the break statement breaks out of a loop.

if i==3: break

 1
Finally, the continue statement skips to the next iteration.

if i==3: continue

 Pythons interpreted nature imposes a speed penalty on it.
Being dynamically-typed, Python uses duck-typing (If it looks like a duck, it must be a duck). This can raise runtime errors.
And then, well, of course. Being easy makes it addictive. Once a Python-coder, always a Python coder.
Q.16. With Python, how do you find out which directory you are currently in?
>>> import os

C:\\Users\\lifei\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32

OR (|) This performs | on each bit pair.
3
>>> 3^2
Binary Ones Complement (~) This returns the ones complement of a value.
-3
>>> 1<<2
Here, 001 was shifted to the left by two places to get 100, which is binary for 4.

Q.39. What data types does Python support?
Numbers ñ Numbers use to hold numerical values.

>>>

 >>> title="Ayushi's Book"
>>> colors=['red','green','blue']

<class list>
>>> name=('Ayushi','Sharma')

Traceback (most recent call last):
name[0]=Avery
Dictionary ñ A dictionary is a data structure that holds key-value pairs. We declare it using curly braces.

>>> type(squares)

 >>> type({})
We can also use a dictionary comprehension:

>>> squares

 Donít miss the complete guide for Python Data Types and Variables
A docstring is a documentation string that we use to explain what a construct does. We place it as the first thing under a function, class, or a method, to describe what it does. We declare a docstring using three sets of single or double-quotes.

"""

"""

>>> sayhi()

 To get a functions docstring, we use its __doc__ attribute.
\n\tThis function prints Hi\n\t
Q.41. How would you convert a string into an int in Python?
>>> int('227')
Lets check the types:
<class str>
<class int>
For taking input from the user, we have the function input(). In Python 2, we had another function raw_input().
>>> a=input('Enter a number')
But if you have paid attention, you know that it takes input in the form of a string.
<class str>
>>> a*=2

77
We use the int() function for this.
Enter a number7
>>> a*=2

14
When we want to execute a sequence of statements, we can give it a name. Lets define a function to take two numbers and return the greater number.

return a is a>b else b

 3.5
When a function makes a call to itself, it is termed recursion. But then, in order for it to avoid forming an infinite loop, we must have a base

>>> def facto(n):

return n*facto(n-1)

 24
One of the less common functions with beginners, zip() returns an iterator of tuples.
[(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)]
>>> list(zip(('a','b','c'),(1,2,3)))
Q.46. How do you calculate the length of a string?
>>> len('Ayushi Sharma')
Q.47. Explain Python List Comprehension.
>>> [i for i in range(1,11,2)]
>>> [i*2 for i in range(1,11,2)]
Q.48. How do you get all values from a Python dictionary?
>>> 'd' in {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4}.values()
>>> 4 in {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4}.values()
Q.49. What if you want to toggle case for a Python string?
>>> 'AyuShi'.swapcase()
Lets apply some concepts now, shall we? Questions 50 through 52 assume the string I love Python. You need to do the needful.
>>> i=0

print(s[i],end=)

 I love Py
>>> for i in s:

print(i,end='')

 Q.52. Now, print this string five times in a row.

print(s)

 I love Python
I love Python
I love Python
Q.53. What is the purpose of bytes() in Python?
>>> bytes([2,4,8])
>>> bytes(5)
>>> bytes('world','utf-8')
Q.54. What is a control flow statement?

                twisted path through the code. Control flow statements let us disturb the normal execution flow of a program and bend it to our will.

 nums=[22,68,110,89,31,12]
>>> [int(i) for i in nums]
Q.56. Given the first and last names of all employees in your firm, what data type will you use to store it?
{first_name:Ayushi,second_name:Sharma
Q.57.¬† How would you work with numbers other than those in the decimal number system?
Binary numbers are made of 0 and 1. To type in binary, we use the prefix 0b or 0B.
10
>>> bin(0xf)
Octal numbers may have digits from 0 to 7. We use the prefix 0o or 0O.
0o10
>>> hex(16)
>>> hex(15)
DataFlairís latest article on Python Numbers with Examples
>>> def extendList(val, list=[]):

return list

>>> list2 = extendList(123,[])

>>> list1,list2,list3

 Youd expect the output to be something like this:
Well, this is because the list argument does not initialize to its default value ([]) every time we make a call to the function. Once we define the function, it creates a new list. Then, whenever we call it again without a list argument, it

Q.59.¬† How many arguments can the range() function take?
a. One argument
>>> list(range(5))
>>> list(range(-5))
>>> list(range(0))
b. Two arguments
>>> list(range(2,7))
>>> list(range(7,2))
>>> list(range(-3,4))
c. Three arguments
>>> list(range(2,9,2))
>>> list(range(9,2,-1))

Q.62. What is the best code you can write to swap two numbers?
>>> a,b=b,a
>>> a,b=2,3

>>> a,b

 Q.63. How can you declare multiple assignments in one statement?
There are two ways to do this:
>>> a,b,c=3,4,5 #This assigns 3, 4, and 5 to a, b, and c respectively
>>> a=b=c=3 #This assigns 3 to a, b, and c
For this, we press Ctrl+C. This interrupts the execution. Lets create an infinite loop to demonstrate this.

Q.65. How do we execute Python?
Revise the concept of Python Compiler
To pass its parameters to a function, Python uses pass-by-reference. If you change a parameter within a function, the change reflects in the calling function. This is its default behavior. However, when we pass literal arguments like strings,

Q.67.¬†What is the with statement in Python?

                at the end. It may be used to open a database connection, do some processing, then automatically close the connection to ensure resources are closed and available for others. with will cleanup the resources even if an exception is thrown.

 The syntax of this control-flow structure is:

Ö.with-block

#processing statements

 While both files hold bytecode, .pyc is the compiled version of a Python file. It has platform-independent bytecode. Hence, we can execute it on any platform that supports the .pyc format. Python automatically generates it to improve performance(in
